This is my second build, the code isn't based off the first, instead, I followed a tutorial, to try some new methods I hadn't seen for myself.
This version takes advantage of the "addEventListener" funciton in JS, which simplifies MUCH of the code and logic in the entire project.
(I wish I though of all this on my own haha)

I did not write most of the code for this webpage myself.
